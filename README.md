# Land Registry on the Blockchain

## **Summary**

According to the World Bank, only 30% of land rights are registered or recorded worldwide.

Throughout the world, there are thousands of plots of land where the rightful owner cannot not be identified, and in many instances ownership is in dispute, due to unreliable data either through fraud or paper based systems.

Since early 2017, various countries have begun to utilize Blockchain technology to facilitate the ownership of land and properties in a decentralized, transparent and immutable network.

"Bringing clarity to land ownership rights will not only reduce corruption, but will also open up trillions of dollars in locked capital.

## **Approach**

A blockchain-based approach to registering property titles to increase the efficiency of transaction processing and reduce property fraud.
